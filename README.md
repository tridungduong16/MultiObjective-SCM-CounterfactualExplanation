# Multi-objective Optimization for Counterfactual Explanation with Structural Causal Model

Code accompanying the paper [Preserving Causal Constraints in Counterfactual Explanations for Machine Learning Classifiers](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.03277), selected for Oral Spotlight at the [NeurIPS 2019 Workshop](http://tripods.cis.cornell.edu/neurips19_causalml/) on Machine learning and Causal Inference for improved decision making

## DiCE

This work is also being integerated with [DiCE](https://github.com/interpretml/DiCE), an open source library for explaining ML models. Please check the this [tutorial](https://github.com/interpretml/DiCE/blob/master/docs/notebooks/DiCE_getting_started_feasible.ipynb) and follow DiCE for updates regarding the same.
