Multi-objective Optimization for Counterfactual Explanation with Structural Causal Model
======================================================================

*How to explain a machine learning model such that the explanation is truthful to the model and yet interpretable to people?*

This is the code used for the paper Prototype-based Counterfactual Explanation for Causal Classification `<https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.00703>`.

I submitted this paper to IJCAI 2021 and got rejected. This work is still in progress. I appreciate your feedback to improve my work. Contact me at TriDung.Duong@student.uts.edu.au
